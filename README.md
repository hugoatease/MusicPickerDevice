It relies on the following dependencies to properly work:

- [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio) for music playback.
- [LiteDB](https://github.com/mbdavid/LiteDB) for local metadata database.
- [Taglib#](https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp) for metadata reading.
- [SocketIoClientDotNet](https://github.com/Quobject/SocketIoClientDotNet) for WebSocket communication.

Change service URL
------------------
Whereas [precompiled binaries](https://github.com/musicpicker/MusicPickerDevice/releases) are built to
reach [musicpicker.net](http://musicpicker.net), source controlled app is configured to
access service at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), which is the default bind for Musicpicker
in source control.

Service URL is bundled in MusicPickerDevice's source code, in *MusicPickerDevice.cs*. 

You can change it to another URL as you need.

    player = new Player(library);
    client = new ApiClient(new Uri("http://localhost:3000"));
    hubConnection = new HubConnection("http://localhost:3000");
